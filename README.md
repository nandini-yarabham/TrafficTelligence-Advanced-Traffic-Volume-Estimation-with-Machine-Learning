# TrafficTelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-with-Machine-Learning
Traffictelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-With-Machine Learning 🚦 Project Overview Trafficeteligence is a smart solution that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to estimate traffic volume accurately in real-time. This project aims to help urban planners and traffic control systems make data-driven decisions to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety.

📌 Key Features 📹 Analyzes traffic video/image data 🧠 Applies ML models to predict traffic volume ⏱ Real-time or batch traffic estimation 📊 Dashboard integration for visualization (optional) 🛣 Supports scalable deployment for smart cities 🧰 Technologies Used Python 🐍 OpenCV for video/image processing Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow (any ML library used) Pandas, NumPy for data handling Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization Flask for web integration (optional) Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation 📁 Project Structure Trafficeteligence/>.ipynb_checkpoints
